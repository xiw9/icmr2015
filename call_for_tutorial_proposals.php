            <p>ICMR 2015 will feature free tutorials on the first day (June 23rd, 2015) addressing the broad interests of the multimedia retrieval community.</p>
            <p>ICMR tutorials aim to provide a comprehensive overview of specific topics in multimedia retrieval. The topic should be of sufficient relevance with respect to the state-of-the-art and the course should be educational rather than a cursory survey of techniques; hands-on tutorials are highly welcome. The audience for ICMR short courses and tutorials consists primarily of graduate students in multimedia retrieval. Although most courses are half-day offerings, we also invite proposals for full-day courses provided that the topic merits the additional time and can be anticipated to generate sufficient interest from our community.</p>
            <p>The proposed tutorial should be linked to the ICMR 2015 topics included in the general call for papers:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Content and context based indexing, search and retrieval of multimedia data</li>
              <li>Multimodal content analysis and retrieval</li>
