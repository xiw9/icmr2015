            <p> In this track we invite visionary papers exploring highly innovative
                ideas and/or paradigm shifts in conventional theory and practice of
                multimedia retrieval. Such papers may for example arise from solid
                mono-disciplinary <strong>completely new ways of thinking</strong>,
                interdisciplinary work bringing <strong>totally new perspectives on
                problems or solutions</strong>, involve <strong>unprecedented scales of data
                volume</strong>, or involve <strong>combinations of information channels not
                pursued before</strong>. There may only be preliminary or dedicated
                experiments as by definition there is typically no baseline to
                compare with. Any paper submitted to this track should have a cover
                page indicating why this paper is submitted to this track, referring
                to the criteria indicated above, and not within the regular ICMR
                long paper track.</p>
