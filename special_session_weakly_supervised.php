            <p>With the explosive growth of visual/acoustic signal data in local and cloud data
centers, as well as the increasing social-networking sites, we have witnessed the
popularity of big data in many multimedia based applications, e.g., large-scale image
and video retrieval. Semantically understanding the content of these multimedia data
can substantially enhance applications based on the large-scale multimedia data. The
major limitation of the many existing models in multimedia and computer vision is
that they are built upon low-level visual features and have limited predictability power
of regional semantics. The problem is known as the "semantic gap" between the
human perception and the low-level visual features. For example, conventional
image/video annotators cannot efficiently and effectively label the semantics of these
large-scale visual/acoustic data. Many of them are designed heuristically and can only
detect a few semantic categories. To effectively fill the semantic gap of visual data in
large-scale applications, weakly supervised learning paradigms are developed recently.
They focus on an intelligent mechanism that transfers the image/video /social level
semantics to different finer levels, e.g., image regions. Compared to the labor-intensive
labeling in the fully supervised setting, the transferring mechanism can greatly reduce
human effort. Extensive efforts have been dedicated to design weakly supervised
learning models that enhance conventional multimedia tasks, while effective tools to
manipulate these data are still at their infancy. This special session will target the most
recent progresses on visual/acoustic semantic understanding with weak supervision.
The possible topics are weakly supervised image segmentation/annotation, photo
aesthetic ranking/cropping/retargeting, object localization/tracking, and video
summarization/recommendation. This special session also targets on applying new
types of weak supervision in semantic modeling, e.g., interactive image rendering and
socially-aware image search. The primary objective of this special session fosters
focused attention on the latest research progress in this interesting area.
