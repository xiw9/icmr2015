            <p>Interactively retrieving information from a large collection of multimedia data is one of the most exciting areas in multimedia research. It requires intricate relations between automatic processing of data and advanced user interfaces to support users in their quest for information.</p>
            <p>The Annual ACM International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval (ICMR) offers a great opportunity for exchanging leading-edge multimedia retrieval ideas among researchers, practitioners and other potential users of multimedia retrieval systems. This conference is set up to illuminate the state of the art in multimedia (text, image, video and audio) retrieval.</p>
            <p>ICMR 2015 is accepting proposals for technical demonstrators that will be showcased during the conference. The session will include demonstrations of latest innovations by research and engineering groups in industry, academia and government. ICMR 2015 is seeking original high quality submissions addressing innovative research in the broad field of multimedia retrieval related to any of the topics defined by ICMR as shown in the call for papers. We solicit two types of contributions:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Demonstrators with innovative interfaces and visualizations showcasing new opportunities, functionality, or the use of multimedia retrieval in new application domains.</li>
            <li>Demonstrations which accompany a research paper presented at the conference to illustrate the potential of the methods presented or providing better understanding of the underlying algorithms. These could also be demonstrators for which the work has been presented before, but with significant interest to the multimedia retrieval field.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>All demo submissions will be peer-reviewed to ensure maximum quality and accepted demo papers will be included in the conference proceedings. The best demos in each category will be awarded and announced during the Social Event. Short introductory presentations of each demo will be given before the demo session.</p>
            <h3>Paper Format</h3>
            <p>Papers must be formatted according to the ACM conference style. Papers of type 1 are allowed a maximum of 4 pages in 9 point font. Papers of type 2 should not exceed 2 pages in 9 point font. While submitting the paper, please make sure that the names and affiliations of the authors are included in the document.</p>
